# E-commerce Platform Assignment
<sub>Please thoroughly read the instructions before starting the assignment.</sub>

## Overview

You are tasked with developing an E-commerce Platform that includes the following features:
- Shopping cart management.
- Application of discount codes.
- Generation of sales reports.

This assignment will help evaluate your skills in both backend and frontend development, focusing on programming logic and database management.

## Setting up the DotNet API

1. Open a terminal in the root directory (Where Program.cs file is)
2. Either run the command `dotnet run` or use any IDE (Visual Studio, vscode) to run the API

## Setting up the Angular application

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `E-Commerce-frontend` directory
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run the command `ng serve` to start the Angular application

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:4200/`

## Functional Requirements

1. **Shopping Cart Management:**
   - Calculate the total value of items in a user's shopping cart, considering discounts and taxes.
    `CartItems` table stores the items in the shopping cart, and `Products` table contains the product details.
    The total value should include the sum of all products in the cart, applying any discounts.
   
2. **Discount Code Application:**
   - Apply discount codes to the shopping cart and validate their conditions.
    `DiscountPercentage` is a value between 0 and 1, representing the percentage discount to apply.
    To apply a discount, the user must enter a valid `DiscountCode` that exists in the `Discounts` table.

3. **Sales Report Generation:**
   - Generate a daily sales report summarizing total revenue and most sold products.
    `Sales` table stores the total amount of each sale, and `SalesItems` table contains the products sold in each sale.
    The report should include the total revenue for the day and the products that were sold the most.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Data Consistency and Integrity:**
   - Ensure data is accurate and consistent.
   
2. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code following best practices.
   
3. **Testing:** (Optional)
   - Include unit tests to verify the functionality of the application.

## Database Schema

Here is the SQLite schema for the E-commerce platform:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName TEXT NOT NULL,
    Price REAL NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Discounts (
    DiscountID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    DiscountCode TEXT NOT,
    DiscountPercentage REAL NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE CartItems (
    CartItemID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INTEGER,
    Quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    TotalAmount REAL NOT NULL,
    SaleDate TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE SalesItems (
    SalesItemID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    SaleID INTEGER,
    ProductID INTEGER,
    Quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
);
```
A SQLite database file `SQLLiteDatabase.db` is included in the project with some sample data.
You can view the database using a SQLite plugin in IDE or any other tool of your choice.

### .NET Web API

- Implement controllers for managing products, discounts, cart items, and generating reports.
- Should include basic CRUD operations and custom endpoints for specific functionalities.
- Add Services for Talking to the SQLite Database

An Example `ProductController` and `ProductService` are Already Made for You.


### Angular Frontend
- Create components for displaying products, managing the shopping cart, and viewing sales reports.

- Show a page for User to Add Products to the their Cart `ShoppingCartComponent`
  The Page should show the following:
  - List of Products
  - Quantity Input for each Product that is added to the Cart
  - Add to Cart Button
  - Total Value of the Cart
  - Discount Code Available and Input Field to Apply Discount Code
  - Apply Discount Button
  - Total Value of the Cart after Discount
    
    Functionality:
  - Add Products to the Cart
  - Increase or Decrease Quantity of the Product in the Cart
  - Calculate Total Value of the Cart
  - Apply Discount Code to the Cart
  - Calculate Total Value of the Cart after Discount
  
- Show a page for Admin to Generate Sales Report `SalesReportComponent`
  The Page should show the following:
    - Total Revenue for the Day
    - Most Sold Products
    - List of Products Sold
    - Quantity of Each Product Sold
    - Total Revenue from Each Product
- Show a Product Management Page `ProductListComponent`
  The Page should show the following:
    - List of Products in a Table
    - Add Product Button
    - Edit Product Button
    - Delete Product Button
    - Form for Adding/Editing Product
  
  Functionality:
    - Add Product
    - Edit Product
    - Delete Product

- Create Services for Talking to the .NET Web API
- Make Minimal User Interface for the E-commerce Platform (You can use Angular Material for this, or any other UI Library of your choice or even plain CSS)
- Make Additional Components and Services as Needed. An Example `ProductListComponent` and `ProductService` are Already Made for You with Basic Functionality.


## Example Flow
- Product Management: Add and Edit products to the database with their name and price.

- Shopping Cart Management: Add items to the cart and display the total value considering discounts and taxes.

- Apply Discount Code: Allow users to apply discount codes to their cart and update the total value accordingly.

- Generate Sales Report: Provide an admin page to generate and view daily sales reports, showing total revenue and most sold products.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while setting up solution, try the following:
- Either run the command `dotnet run` or use any IDE (Visual Studio, vscode) to run the API
- Run the command `ng serve` to start the Angular application inside the `E-Commerce-frontend` folder, after installing the necessary packages through `npm`
- If you are unable to set up the angular application, you can use the tools like postman or curl to test the API and Complete Half of the Assignment
- Make sure you have the latest versions of .Net 7 SDK, Node.js, and npm installed, appropriate Angular version.
- Check that the API is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5182/swagger/index.html`, or the appropriate port if you have changed it.
- If you get a CORS error, make sure that the correct origins are allowed in the API
